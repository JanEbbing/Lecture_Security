# Lecture_Security
Collection of excercises from my lecture about it security

CAUTION: For exercise and revision purposes, I implemented some
widespread cryptographic functions, such as textbook RSA. ALL of them
are insecure, as implemented here. Please adhere to "Don't roll your own
crypto" and don't use it for data you wouldn't store or send in plain
text. Instead use one of the standard libraries like OpenSSL.
